                Entries should be -1, 0, +1, or 2. A 0 represents an empty cell,
                and a 2 represents a cell that has at most one point in it.
                Otherwise, a +1 represents an increasing cell, and

                of the columns. Entries should be +1 or -1. If col[i] is +1,

                of the rows. Entries should be +1 or -1. If row[j] is +1,
