- Removing `Permutation.bend_list` since it never seeemed to work anyways.
- Removing `Permutation.insertion_locations`.
- Removing `Permutation.num_consecutive_3214`.
- Generally using Google-style Python docstrings.
- Things kept only for reverse compatability have been moved to PermutationDeprecatedMixin and decorated with a warning that they're deprecated. I think these should be removed.
- I'm tempted by code formatters (e.g. black, flake8), but I'd like to learn more about them before committing to one.


TODOs
- PermClass should be based on some test.
- AvClass should require a basis.
